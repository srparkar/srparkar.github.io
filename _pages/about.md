<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
I am a graduate of the Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence program at Stevens Institute of Technology, where I specialized in AI-augmented wireless systems, intelligent sensing architectures, and real-time signal processing. My academic work bridges the intersection of communication, sensing, and machine learning, with a focus on advancing contactless health monitoring and edge intelligence in next-generation networks.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
My core research focuses on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) using mmWave radar and 5G NR waveforms, AI-driven physical layer optimization, and federated learning within O-RAN architectures. I actively explore deep learning approaches for wireless signal classification, synthetic augmentation for imbalanced data, and distributed AI at the wireless edge. I have also worked on RF fingerprinting and V2X slicing prediction in software-defined radio environments, expanding my familiarity with vehicular communication systems.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
I previously completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at Mumbai University, where I built a strong foundation in machine learning, data structures, cloud computing, computer networks, applied data analytics, cryptography, and mobile computing. These courses laid the groundwork for my continued research in AI-powered communication systems and intelligent edge inference.
