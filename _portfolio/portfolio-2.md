Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) offers a transformative approach to cellular network design by promoting a virtualized, open, and intelligent architecture. The increasing complexity and security demands of modern cellular networks necessitate robust methods for device identification and management. This paper provides a way for integrating Federated Learning for device fingerprinting within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) framework, enhancing network security and device management. Our approach leverages unique RF signal characteristics, captured through Channel State Information (CSI), to identify devices without the need for centralized data processing or custom hardware. We set up a real-world experimental environment using the POWDER Wireless testbed, simulating O-RAN with base stations and user equipment. Using a deep learning model to process the CSI data to classify devices. With an xAPP deployed on a Near Real-Time Radio Intelligent Controller (RT-RIC), our model uses a federated learning approach for distributed training across base stations. Initial results demonstrate nearly 99.75% accuracy in device identification, showcasing the potential of our approach to integrate advanced AI techniques in O-RAN for improved network performance and security. This research underscores the feasibility and practical effectiveness of enhancing next-generation cellular networks through O-RANâ€™s open and intelligent architecture.
