At <em>**Stevens Institute of Technology**</em>, we held a month-long, NSF CyberTraining workshop designed to train Masterâ€™s students in **next-generation wireless technologies**. The program emphasized hands-on learning across key areas such as **Software-Defined Radios (SDRs)**, **mmWave sensing**, **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)**, and **Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN)**. Through intensive weekly sessions covering the theoretical concepts and practical applications, participants engaged directly with real-world experimental platforms to build both foundational knowledge and technical fluency in advanced wireless systems.


Spanning four weeks, the program was structured to progressively build hands-on experience across:

### ðŸ“‘ Topics We Covered
Participants will dive into:
- **Week 1**: USRP configuration and GNU Radio basics for Software-Defined Radios (SDR).
- **Week 2**: FMCW waveform generation, live radar deployment and data collection.
- **Week 3**: FMCW signal processing pipeline design for respiration monitoring.
- **Week 4**: O-RAN architecture, Near-RT RIC deployment, and xApp-based experimentation.

Throughout the program, students will explore concepts of **28â€¯GHz mmWave sensing**, **xApp development and deployment within O-RAN architectures**, and **Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)** systems.

This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

Headings are cool
